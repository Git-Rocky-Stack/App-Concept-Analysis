# Strategia-X Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Introduction

Strategia-X ("the App", "we", "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles information when you use our AI-powered app concept analysis tool.

**Key Principle:** Strategia-X is designed with privacy at its core. All AI processing happens locally in your browser, and we do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data or app ideas to our servers.

---

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Unlike many AI-powered applications, Strategia-X:

*   **Does NOT send your app ideas to external AI servers** - All AI processing uses WebLLM, which runs entirely in your browser
*   **Does NOT create user accounts** - No registration required
*   **Does NOT track your usage patterns** - No analytics or telemetry
*   **Does NOT collect personal information** - No names, emails, or identifiers
*   **Does NOT use cookies for tracking** - Only essential browser storage for app functionality

---

## Local Data Storage

The App stores the following data **locally on your device only** using your browser's localStorage:

### Saved Ideas
*   App concepts you explicitly save using the "heart" icon
*   Stored in your browser's localStorage
*   Never transmitted to any server
*   Cleared when you clear browser data

### License Information
*   Your Pro license key (if activated)
*   License activation status
*   Stored locally for session persistence
*   Never shared with third parties

### Usage Tracking (Free Tier)
*   Daily generation count (for free tier limits)
*   Resets daily at midnight
*   Stored locally only

### Preferences
*   Theme preference (light/dark mode)
*   Tour completion status
*   Stored in localStorage

---

## AI Processing

### Local AI (WebLLM)
*   **Technology:** WebLLM with Llama 3.2 3B Instruct model
*   **Processing Location:** 100% in your browser
*   **Data Transmission:** None - your prompts and app ideas never leave your device
*   **Model Storage:** Cached in your browser (~2GB, downloaded once)

### Image Generation (Pollinations.ai)
When you use the "Generate Concept Art" feature:
*   A text prompt describing your app concept is sent to Pollinations.ai
*   **What is sent:** App title, tagline, and category (no personal data)
*   **What is NOT sent:** Your personal information, full app descriptions, or analysis data
*   Pollinations.ai is a free, public image generation service
*   Please review [Pollinations.ai's privacy practices](https://pollinations.ai) for their data handling

## Sharing Features

### Share Links
*   When you click "Share," a URL is generated containing your app idea data
*   This data is encoded in the URL (not stored on any server)
*   Anyone with the link can view that specific idea
*   You control what you share - no automatic sharing

### Export Features
*   JSON, CSV, and PDF exports are generated locally
*   Files are downloaded directly to your device
*   No data is sent to external servers during export

---

## Data Security

*   All data remains on your device in browser localStorage
*   No server-side databases or cloud storage
*   HTTPS encryption for all web traffic
*   No passwords or sensitive credentials stored

---

## Children's Privacy

Strategia-X is intended for business and professional use. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided data through our app, please contact us.

---

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data on servers, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) are managed by you directly:

*   **Access:** Your data is in your browser's localStorage
*   **Delete:** Clear your browser data or localStorage
*   **Portability:** Use the Export feature to download your data

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
